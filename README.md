## Extra Info
Most of this code is very roughly based on JerwuQu's work, though the python is completely written from scratch: https://github.com/JerwuQu/arctis-nova-oled/
If you want to use this, you'll probably want to setup the udev rules from that repo as well: https://github.com/JerwuQu/arctis-nova-oled/blob/master/11-steelseries-arctis-nova.rules
